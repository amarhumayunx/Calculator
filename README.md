# ðŸ§® **Calculator Project** ðŸ§®

## ðŸŒŸ Overview

Welcome to the **Calculator Project**! This is a simple yet powerful **C++ console application** that allows users to perform various arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, and more. The program features an interactive menu to guide users through operations and even supports evaluating mathematical expressions directly.
